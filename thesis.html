    <h3><span class="highlight">Objective: Design an app and create a 3D model based on my thesis product.

 </h3>
<h4> App design | 3D model </h4>

      <p>A major project in my time at Niagara college. A project two semesters long. For our thesis we were to come up with a problem related to us in some way and find a solution for that problem. For me, i choose a therapeutic massage chair connected to an app. This stems from the back pain I’ve had in the past and not seeking proper therapy.

    <div class="col col-2-thirds"> 

    <h3><span class="highlight"> What's the reason? </h3>



      <p>My thesis is based on people who abuse their backs, ignoring the consequences. Therapeutic massage chairs are on the market, however, this isn’t any ordinary massage chair in your living room. This is a 3 piece full body massage chair can be folded to take with you. This is targeted for those with benefit plans and professional athletes to rent out the product for they don’t always have the convenience of going to a massage therapist. The 3 sections of the massage chair are the neck massager to better hit your neck muscles, leg massager unit, and the chair itself. Arm and foot massager’s are also added to this product as an extra.

      <p>Working on this project allowed me to learn a lot in softwares such as XD and Fusion 360.
      XD was used to design the app which would be later viewed as a prototype for you to interact with. The app is divided by 5 sections. The top right would be series of exercises to strengthen your muscles.

      <p>Bottom right is for health assistance. This section will help you determine a problem by simple tapping the muscle chart that is sore and asking a few basic questions. After the questions are answered, the app will send you a link that will be saved in your resources.

      <p> The 3D model was created in fusion 360. The model was created to present how the massage chair would look. In this image is the chair component folded. The handle in the back is used for you to carry it as a suitcase. Due to the 200 pounds of technology , this would be the easiest way for transportation. </p>
