      <p>Coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was to code a website for a book called “Alice in wonderland”. After coding it i transfered the code to a php file that would be uploaded in word-press to view.

</p>
<p>The home page shows one image centered with a top and side navigation. The image itself is a flip style and will show two sketches i created. The top navigation has three links. The link will take you to Amazon where you can physically buy the book. The second will take you to the chapters page. The third link will take you back to the home page. The side navigation has a list of all the chapters. Each chapter has it’s own sketch i created with the body text set at a justified position.

<p>
Though the web is a great way to view books some people also prefer the physical touch and look of a book. I wanted to incorporate some of the look aspects on my site. Drawings i created with a pencil and pen to give a unique and personal style. The worn out paper background is there throughout the site to give you the feeling that you are reading an old worn out book.

     <p>One of the first websites i've ever coded. This website was created to advertise William Gibsons top books. The website itself is simple and easy to navigate through. The main content is the book slider using javascipt. Each book will have a brief summary and button to buy the book.

      <p>Here i was to code a website that connects us to both the web and real world. I came up with the idea on involving space and time. The earth makes a whole rotation in a year. When you first visit the site the earth and moon will have an infinite rotation. The side navigation has different months. If you click on one of the months the earth will stop rotating and go in the direction the earth would be from the sun at that time of the year.
       </p> 
       <p> This was a fun project mostly involving css. Though Javascript was added to bring the earth on different rotations. </p>
