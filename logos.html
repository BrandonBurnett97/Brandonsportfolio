    <h3><span class="highlight">Objective: Design a pirate themed Coffee brand for packaging
 </h3>


      <p>I needed to come up with a coffee brand. The coffee brand name is Morgan. A brand to represent dark roast coffee. The conclusion was pirate themed. The first stage of my design process came with analyzing and researching the history of pirates. What was the first thing that came to mind when you heard the word? Ships, swords, the deep sea. Pirates are ruggid by nature, so i needed to apply that to my design. With that in mind, the design didn’t need to be pretty, nothing shiny or colorful. Something with a dirty brown matt look to show off that rigid feeling that represented the look of pirates.

    <h3><span class="highlight">Coffee package </h3>



      <p>A ship in a sea storm was designed on the back of the coffee packaging. Only the sea is colored brown, the representation of dark roast coffee. The logo has a anchor and a pirate skull as the middle piece. A flag is included to represent a ship while at the bottom of the anchor shows wheel from a ship. Luminari regular typeface was used for the coffee title “Morgan” while Snell round hand was used for the initials up top of the logo.</p>

    <h3><span class="highlight">Objective: Create a unique and playful brand to represent a health smoothie business

 </h3>

      <p>For this design, i branded a health smoothie shop called Elite Prime. Unlike most smoothie shops, Elite prime has a reputation of creating only the healthiest smoothies targeted for those who are vegetarians, and for people who go to the gym and need a preworkout drink. The brand needed to stick out, when you looked at their brand you need to see their goal as a company, light green was a big factor.

    <h3><span class="highlight"> Branding </h3>


      <p>Green is natural, it’s the color of nature, so light green for their paperwork, business cards, and menus was added to show that. The logo itself has a stronger lime green, blue, and red. These colors represent kiwi, blueberries, strawberries and rasberrie,. The fruit groups that were added to create these health smoothies, so i thought it would be a great idea to incorporate that in their logo.
      Type- Old Claude IPS was used with this logo. </p>

 </h3>

      <p> Logo for my thesis project. My thesis was based on a massage chair that is connected to an app.</p>
      <p>
The goal was to create something simple, peaceful, and strong. The wavy line represents the massage chair, where the circles on top of it represent the massage rollers. The name came from it’s definition. Being at peace. </p>
