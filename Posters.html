<h3><span class="highlight">Objective: Design a typographic poster 
 </h3>
   

      <p> The goal was to design a music show event. I used my favorite bands and brought them together in a typographic themed advertisement. I created this design during the Fall season, so that was my inspiration for the color and leaves.

<h3><span class="highlight">Objective: Design poster based on a Brazilian yoga event.

 </h3>
   

      <p>The Rio De Yoga is a Brazilian yoga festival. In Brazilian culture, they dress up in beautiful primary and secondary colors for many of their traditions. I applied those color pallets to my poster design. The figure is in a yoga pose. Wearing a traditional headpiece but also representing Christ the redeemer statue located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

 I wanted people to look at this poster and know what itâ€™s about at first glance. The land in the background is exactly the same as the scenery looking at the front of the Christ the Redeemer.

    <h3><span class="highlight">Objective: Create a poster showing the pros of aging. </h3>

      <p>A company called Ageworks was looking for a poster design to advertise their movement on the positives on aging. They were looking for a poster that tells people that aging isn't so bad, and that there are benefits to being a senior.<p> 
        <p> Often times we see the grandparents babysitting the children while the parents are working. Talking with seniors, some of them stated that they enjoy spending time with children because it's paying it forward to the next generation. That was the inspiration for this poster. </p>
        <p> The watch represents the knowledge and experience of aging with time, paying it forward to the new generation. The message behind this poster is that it's important to remember those who taught us and that one day we will be old, but we will have more knowledge and wisdom to give to the world when we're gone. </p>
